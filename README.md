## The goal
We want to provide an easy way to run multiple well-known pathway enrichment analysis methods using a single, standarized command line interface.

Currently we plan to include iPANDA, GSEA, Impact Analysis (Pathway-Express) and CONEXIC methods, as described in the original publications, with an option to extend the support for many more.

We wish to re-use existing code (where it is permitted by appropriate licences) for some methods and rewrite or implement other methods using Python3.

Documentation for already implemented pieces of code is hosted at: [pathways-analysis.readthedocs.io](http://pathways-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
